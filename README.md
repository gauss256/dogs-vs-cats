# Dogs vs. Cats
Code and notebooks for the Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats competition

## Overview of the code
  * Notebook: [Exploratory data analysis of image sizes](https://github.com/gauss256/dogs-vs-cats/blob/master/EDA%20of%20Image%20Sizes.ipynb)
  * Notebook: [Image preprocessing](https://github.com/gauss256/dogs-vs-cats/blob/master/Image%20Preprocessing.ipynb)

## Prerequisites
I use Anaconda Python 3.5 on Ubuntu 14.04.
  
You should be able to recreate my environment in a new Conda environment via

```conda create -n new environment --file requirements.txt```

but I've never actually tried this myself. The requirements list is scary long because it was automaticallygenerated. Many of the packages come with a standard Anaconda installation. I would just start with that and add libraries as they are found to be missing.
